CHANGELOG

EventConsolev2 - Second iteration at attempting to essentially write an event parser and editor(to come later).

This project is made available to give you an idea of how to parse the Myth of Somas quests and maybe build your own editor (which is my next step). 

As this isn't an editor, the best it does is cleans up old ; comment lines from Esoma and other Somas and puts in extra spacing but its intent is to show someone "how " they might create an editor with some of the parsing already done and code available. 
Oh and I didn't say it was efficient or bug free, I'm just a hobbyist.

With me sharing this, I do it in the hope to encourage others to also share as they learn too.

v0.01
-Initial load of a sample .evt file and load into a custom type, in a list.  Appears to parse fine and completely.

v0.02
- Search for an evt ability by number alone.
- Will create an output to a .evt file if option taken
- Added save and end blocks as part of the output to a new .evt file

v0.03
-Added some code to put the ; (comment) below the event number but above the event itself. So there is some nice inline information.
-FunctionParams are now a string array instead of an int array to handle a couple of cases of bad casting, which also fixes the numerics below 10.
-User can now type a file name of an evt to load and save but there is no error handling.

v0.04
-Fixed missing 'END' of the block when displaying the found event.
-Fixed knock on effect of displaying extra empty lines.
-Added a loop if an event number is not found / incorrect.

-----

Fixes

-Does not retain commented lines (;) and ignores them (As of v0.02 these are saved providing they exist within the event block, this is purposely to make them "inline" and readable whilst associated to the event)
-Does not save the start and end blocks (EVENT XXXX and END) but event ids are retained (Added as part of the output in v0.02)
-Parsing of Params is stripping the leading 0... May not be important. Leaving as is for now. If it presents a problem for < 10 numbers, can just treat them as strings instead (urgh). (Fixed in v0.03)
-Need to offer up choices to load a file, save and search rather than anything else. (Added as of v0.03, not worth adding much more for a console application).

Limitations

- Little / No sanity checking.
