CHANGELOG
-----
EventConsolev2 - Second iteration at attempting to essentially write an event parser and editor(to come later).

v0.01
-Initial load of a sample .evt file and load into a custom type, in a list.  Appears to parse fine and completely.

-----
Limitations / WIP

-Does not retain commented lines (;) and ignores them
-Does not save the start and end blocks (EVENT XXXX and END) but event ids are retained
