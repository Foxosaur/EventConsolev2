CHANGELOG
-----
EventConsolev2 - Second iteration at attempting to essentially write an event parser and editor(to come later).

v0.01
-Initial load of a sample .evt file and load into a custom type, in a list.  Appears to parse fine and completely.

v0.02
- Search for an evt ability by number alone.
- Will create an output to a .evt file if option taken
- Added save and end blocks as part of the output to a new .evt file

v0.03
-Added some code to put the ; (comment) below the event number but above the event itself. So there is some nice inline information.

-----
Limitations / WIP

-Does not retain commented lines (;) and ignores them
-Does not save the start and end blocks (EVENT XXXX and END) but event ids are retained (Added as part of the output in v0.02)
-Parsing of Params is stripping the leading 0... May not be important. Leaving as is for now. If it presents a problem for < 10 numbers, can just treat them as strings instead (urgh).
-Need to offer up choices to load a file, save and search rather than anything else.
